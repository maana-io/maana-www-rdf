Recent changes to this namespace:
$Log: wgs84_pos.rdf,v $
Revision 1.22  2009/04/20 15:00:30  timbl
Remove the time bits which have been deal with elsewhere eg in iCal.

Revision 1.21  2009/04/20 12:52:47  timbl
try again

Revision 1.20  2009/04/20 12:42:11  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.19  2009/04/20 12:36:31  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.18  2006/02/01 22:01:04  danbri
Clarified that lat and long are decimal degrees, and that alt is decimal metres about local reference ellipsoid

Revision 1.17  2004/02/06 17:38:12  danbri
Fixed a bad commit screwup

Revision 1.15  2003/04/19 11:24:08  danbri
Fixed the typo even more.

Revision 1.14  2003/04/19 11:16:56  danbri
fixed a typo

Revision 1.13  2003/02/19 22:27:27  connolly
relaxed domain constraints on lat/long/alt from Point to SpatialThing

Revision 1.12  2003/01/12 01:41:41  danbri
Trying local copy of XSLT doc.

Revision 1.11  2003/01/12 01:20:18  danbri
added a link to morten's xslt rdfs viewer.

Revision 1.10  2003/01/11 18:56:49  danbri
Removed datatype range from lat and long properties, since they would
have required each occurance of the property to mention the datatype.

Revision 1.9  2003/01/11 11:41:31  danbri
Another typo; repaired rdfs:Property to rdf:Property x4

Revision 1.8  2003/01/11 11:05:02  danbri
Added an rdfs:range for each lat/long/alt property,
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float

Revision 1.7  2003/01/10 20:25:16  danbri
Longer rdfs:comment for Point, trying to be Earth-centric and neutral about
coordinate system(s) at the same time. Feedback welcomed.

Revision 1.6  2003/01/10 20:18:30  danbri
Added CVS log comments into the RDF/XML as an rdfs:comment property of the
vocabulary. Note that this is not common practice (but seems both harmless
and potentially useful).


revision 1.5
date: 2003/01/10 20:14:31;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +16 -5
Updated schema:
Added a dc:date, added url for more info. Changed the rdfs:label of the
namespace from gp to geo. Added a class Point, set as the rdfs:domain of
each property. Added XML comment on the lat_long property suggesting that
we might not need it (based on #rdfig commentary from implementors).

revision 1.4
date: 2003/01/10 20:01:07;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -5
Fixed typo; several rdfs:about attributes are now rdf:about. Thanks to MortenF in
#rdfig for catching this error.

revision 1.3
date: 2003/01/10 11:59:03;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -3
fixed buglet in vocab, added more wgs links

revision 1.2
date: 2003/01/10 11:01:11;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
Removed alt from the as-a-flat-string property, and switched from
space separated to comma separated.

revision 1.1
date: 2003/01/10 10:53:23;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;
